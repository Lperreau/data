  Founded by Coinbase and Circle in 2018, the mission is to provide the
  governance and standards for the future digital financial ecosystem.


  We began by launching US Dollar Coin (USDC), a fiat-backed stablecoin and now the second largest stablecoin on the market. The standards we laid out for USDC provide a layer of trust and transparency so that users can operate with security and confidence as we enter a new world of digital payments.
